# The Torch Scraper

*Created by the [Vacuous Versifier](https://github.com/vacuousVersifier)*

*See this project's [GitHub](https://github.com/vacuousVersifier/TorchScraper)*

This project is a simple web scraper to extract information about stories
posted to [The Torch](https://shsthetorch.com/), a publication by the students of
[Wichita High School South](https://www.usd259.org/south), a part of USD259.

This program impersonates a staff of the Torch using their cookies for login.
It then scrapes a list of current staff and the stories they have written,
finally printing out spreadsheet friendly results for analysis.

This program has existed in a worse form for about two years, but has now been
totally revamped. Being I will graduate in May 2024, the project will likely die
out then. However, as I hope, perhaps new editors will find use in this and
I will have an excuse to continue working on it!
